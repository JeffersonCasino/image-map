        <p class="content-row">The status bar is a graphical control element used to display certain status information
            within an application or operating system. It typically appears at the bottom of a window or screen and
            provides information such as the current state of the application, system status indicators (like battery
            life, Wi-Fi signal strength, time, etc.), notifications, and sometimes progress indicators for ongoing
            tasks. In mobile devices, it's often used to show system information like battery percentage, network
            connectivity, time, and notifications. In desktop operating systems, it may display similar information but
            can also include details like the current document's word count, zoom level, or other relevant
            application-specific data.</p>
