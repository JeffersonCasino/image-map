        <p class="content-row">The home button typically refers to a physical or virtual button found on electronic
            devices such as smartphones, tablets, and some computers. Its primary function is to serve as a quick way to
            return to the device's home screen or main interface from any other app or screen. On smartphones, for
            example, pressing the physical home button or tapping the virtual home button takes you back to the device's
            main screen where you can access apps, widgets, or other features. However, with the trend towards
            gesture-based navigation and virtual home buttons on some devices, the concept of a physical home button is
            becoming less common.</p>
