        <img src="" class="img">
        <p class="content-row">The Lightning connector is a proprietary connector developed by Apple Inc. It was first
            introduced in 2012 with the launch of the iPhone 5, replacing the previous 30-pin dock connector used in
            earlier iPhone models. The Lightning connector is used for charging, syncing data, and connecting various
            accessories to Apple devices such as iPhones, iPads, and iPods. It is smaller in size compared to the older
            30-pin connector and is reversible, meaning it can be plugged in either way, making it more convenient for
            users.</p>
