        <p class="content-row">The front camera, also known as the selfie camera or secondary camera, is the camera on a smartphone, tablet, or laptop that is oriented towards the user. It allows individuals to take pictures or record videos of themselves, typically for selfies or video calls. Front cameras have become increasingly important in modern devices, often featuring high resolutions and additional features such as facial recognition for security purposes or augmented reality effects for fun and creative applications.</p>
