        <p class="content-row">Volume buttons are physical buttons typically found on electronic devices such as
            smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other gadgets. They are used to adjust the volume level of the device's
            audio output. Usually, there are two volume buttons: one for increasing the volume (usually marked with a
            plus sign "+"), and one for decreasing the volume (usually marked with a minus sign "-"). Pressing these
            buttons adjusts the volume accordingly, allowing users to make the audio louder or quieter to suit their
            preferences or needs.</p>
