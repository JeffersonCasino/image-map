        <p class="content-row">A headset jack, also known as an audio jack or headphone jack, is a socket on electronic
            devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, and audio players that allows you to connect headphones or
            external speakers. It's typically a small round hole into which you insert the plug of your headphones or
            speakers. Once connected, audio signals can be transmitted from the device to the headphones or speakers,
            allowing you to listen to music, videos, or other audio content privately or aloud. There are different
            sizes of headset jacks, with the most common ones being 3.5 mm and 6.35 mm.</p>
