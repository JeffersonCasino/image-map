        <p class="content-row">A bottom microphone typically refers to a microphone located at the bottom of a device,
            such as a smartphone or a tablet. This microphone is used for various purposes, including capturing audio
            during phone calls, recording videos, or picking up ambient sounds for features like noise cancellation or
            voice commands. The term "bottom" refers to its physical location on the device, usually near the charging
            port or speaker grill at the bottom edge.</p>
