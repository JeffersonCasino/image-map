        <p class="content-row">The sleep/wake button, also known as the power button or the side button, is a physical
            button typically found on the side or top of smartphones, tablets, and some other electronic devices. Its
            primary function is to turn the device on or off, or to put it to sleep or wake it up from sleep mode. On
            many devices, pressing this button briefly will turn the screen on or off, while holding it down for a
            longer period will power the device on or off. It's a handy feature for conserving battery life and quickly
            accessing your device's functions.</p>
