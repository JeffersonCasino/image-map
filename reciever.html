        <p class="content-row">A receiver/front microphone typically refers to a microphone built into the front or
            receiver portion of a communication or recording device. In devices such as smartphones or headsets, this
            microphone is often used for capturing the user's voice during phone calls, voice commands, or audio
            recordings. It's called a "receiver/front" microphone because it's positioned in the part of the device that
            faces the user's mouth when held up to speak or listen.</p>
